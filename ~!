## Your task

**Your task** is to fully complete [UC Pacman Project 1 - Search](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html). You **must build and submit your solution** using the sample code we provide you in this repository, which is different from the original UC code base. If you want to provide a report with your submission (e.g., reflections, acknowledgments, etc.), please do so in file [REPORT.md](REPORT.md).

* You should **only work and modify** files `search.py` and `searchAgents.py` in doing your solution. Do not change the other Python files in this distribution.

* Your code **must run _error-free_ on Python 3.6**. Staff will not debug/fix any code. Using a different version will risk your program not running with the Pacman infrastructure or autograder and may risk losing (all) marks. You can install Python 3.6 from the [official site](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/), or set up a [Conda environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c/) or an environment with [PIP+virtualenv](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/). See also [these questions](https://piazza.com/class/kd49qfdh119p6?cid=6) in the Piazza FAQ-pacman for more info.

* Your code **must not have carry any personal information**, like your student number or your name. That info should go in the [TEAM.md](TEAM.md) file, as per instructions below. If you use an IDE that inserts your name, student number, or username, you should disable that.


### Create a private repository (0 marks)

**TBC for github classroom:**
Before you start your assignment, you'll need to create a github repository.
Navigate to https://github.com and register an account then use the 'New Repository' button to create a repository for your project work. Make sure you select a `Private' repository. This will ensure your repository can only be accessed by you and by the teaching staff, otherwise your repository may be viewable by others in the class.

You must ALWAYS keep your fork **private** and **never share it** with anybody in or outside the course, except your teammates, _even after the course is completed_. You are not allowed to make another repository copy outside the provided GitHub Classroom without the written permission of the teaching staff. Please respect the [authors request](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_instructions.html): 

> **_Please do not distribute or post solutions to any of the projects._**

Remember to complete the [TEAM.md](TEAM.md) file with the team details of the submission.

### Practice Task (0 marks)

To familiarise yourself with basic search algorithms and the Pacman environment, it is a good start to implement the tasks at https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project1.html, especially the first four tasks; however, there is no requirement to do so. We have implemented the `Depth First Search' task for you to help you understand how to interact with the project framework.

### Part 1 (3 marks)

Implement the Iterative Deepening Search algorithm discussed in lectures. You should be able to test the algorithm using the following command:

**python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ids**

Other layouts are available in the layouts directory, and you can easily create you own!

### Part 2 (4 marks)

Implement the Enforced Hill Climbing algorithm discussed in lectures, using Manhattan Distance as the heuristic. Note that you don't have to implement Manhattan Distance, as this this has already been implemented for you in the code, although you will need to call the heuristic from inside your search. You should be able to test the algorithm using the following command:

**python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ehc**

Other layouts are available in the layouts directory, and you can easily create you own!


### Part 3 (3 marks) - Challenge Question (more difficult) 

This part involves solving a more complicated problem. Just like in Q7 of the Berkerley Pacman framework, you will be required to create an agent that will eat all of the food (dots) in a maze. In this version, however, to reach the food you have to eat a ghost as the food is situated *behind* stationary ghosts (in this version the ghosts do not move) and further, to eat a ghost you must *first* eat a **Capsule** that is present in the maze. 
Your code should ensure that no ghosts are eaten before a Capsule is eaten.
You can assume that there is always exactly one Capsule in the maze, and that there will always be at least one path from Pacman's starting point to the capsule that doesn't pass through any ghosts or food.

In order to implement this, you should create a new problem called CapsuleSearchProblem and a new agent called CapsuleSearchAgent. You will also need to implement a suitable foodHeuristic. You may choose to implement other helper classes/functions. You should be able to test your program by running the following code:

**python pacman.py -l capsuleSearch -p CapsuleSearchAgent**
**-a fn=wastar,prob=CapsuleSearchProblem,heuristic=foodHeuristic**

An agent that eats the capsule then proceeds to eat all of the food on the maze will receive 3 marks. The remaining 3 marks will be based on the performance of your agent (i.e. number of nodes expanded), as in Q7 of the Berkeley problem. Since you are using the A\* algorithm, however, the number of node expansions required for each grade will vary.

## Marking criteria

Marks are allocated according to the task breakdown listed above, based on how many of our tests the algorithms pass. No marks will be given for code formatting, etc. Observe that while the automarker is a useful indication of your performance, it may not represent the ultimate mark. We reserve the right to run more tests, inspect your code and repo manually, and arrange for a face-to-face meeting for a discussion and demo of your solution if needed.  You must **follow good SE practices**, including good use of git during your development such as:

* _Commit early, commit often:_ single or few commits with all the solution or big chucks of it, is not good practice.
* _Use meaningful commit messages:_ as a comment in your code, the message should clearly summarize what the commit is about. Messages like "fix", "work", "commit", "changes" are poor and do not help us understand what was done.
* _Use atomic commits:_ avoid commits doing many things; let alone one commit solving many questions of the project. Each commit should be about one (little but interesting) thing. 

## Checking your submission

Run the command:

**python autograder.py**

to run sanity checks for our tests, called comp90054-part1, comp90054-part2, comp90054-part31 and comp90054-part-32. It is important that you are able to run the autograder and have these tests pass, otherwise, our marking scripts will NOT work on your submission.

**NOTE**: You should not change any files other than search.py and searchAgents.py. You should not import any additional libraries into your code. This risks being incompatible with our marking scripts.



## Submission Instructions

This repository serves as a start code for you to carry out your solution for [Project 1 - Search](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html) from the set of [UC Pacman Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). 

**To submit your assignment** you must complete the following three steps:

1. Fully complete the [TEAM.md](TEAM.md) file with the team details of the submission (even if it is an individual assignment).
2. Check that your solution runs on Python 3.6 and that your source code does not include personal information, like your student number or name. 
3. Tag the commit version you want to be graded with tag `submission`. 
    * The commit and tagging should be dated before the deadline.
    * Note that a tag is NOT a branch, so do not just create a branch called "submission" as that will not amount to tagging.
4. Fill the [Project 1 Certification Form](https://forms.gle/BzDH4ea5iennKbHe8).
    * Non-certified submissions will not be marked and will attract zero marks.

### Initial Submission (0 marks)

By the initial submission date, you must have completed the tasks in the `Creating a private repository' section. On this date we will clone your repository to ensure that we are able to
access it.

### Final Submission
The master branch on your repository will be cloned at the due date and time. From this repository, we will copy *only* the files: **search.py** and **searchAgents.py**. Do not change any other file as part of your solution, or it will not run. Breaking these instructions breaks our marking scripts, delays marks being returned, and more importantly, gives us a headache.
      
Submissions not compatible with the instructions in this document will attract zero marks and do not warrant a re-submission. Staff will not debug or fix your submission.

## Important information

**Corrections:** From time to time, students or staff find errors (e.g., typos, unclear instructions, etc.) in the assignment specification. In that case, corrected version of this file will be produced, announced, and distributed for you to commit and push into your repository.  Because of that, you are NOT to modify this file in any way to avoid conflicts.

**Late submissions & extensions:** A penalty of 10% of the maximum mark per day will apply to late assignments up to a maximum of five days, and 100% penalty thereafter. Extensions will only be permitted in _exceptional_ circumstances; refer to [this question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17YdTmDC54WHq0uZ-2UX3U8ESwULyBDJSD4SjKCrPXlA/edit?usp=sharing) in the course FAQs. 

**About this repo:** You must ALWAYS keep your fork **private** and **never share it** with anybody in or outside the course, except your teammates, _even after the course is completed_. You are not allowed to make another repository copy outside the provided GitHub Classroom without the written permission of the teaching staff. Please respect the [authors request](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_instructions.html): 

> **_Please do not distribute or post solutions to any of the projects._**

**Academic Dishonesty:** This is an advanced course, so we expect full professionalism and ethical conduct.  Plagiarism is a serious issue. Please **don't let us down and risk our trust**. The staff take academic misconduct very seriously. Sophisticated _plagiarism detection_ software (e.g., [Codequiry](https://codequiry.com/), [Turinitin](https://www.turnitin.com/), etc.) will be used to check your code against other submissions in the class as well as resources available on the web for logical redundancy. These systems are really smart, so just do not risk it and keep professional. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us according to the **University Academic Integrity policy**. For more information on this see file [Academic Integrity](ACADEMIC_INTEGRITY.md).

**We are here to help!:** We are here to help you! But we don't know you need help unless you tell us. We expect reasonable effort from you side, but if you get stuck or have doubts, please seek help. We will ran labs to support these projects, so use them! While you have to be careful to not post spoilers in the forum, you can always ask general questions about the techniques that are required to solve the projects. If in doubt whether a questions is appropriate, post a Private post to the instructors.

**Silence Policy:** A silence policy will take effect **48 hours** before this assignment is due. This means that no question about this assignment will be answered, whether it is asked on the newsgroup, by email, or in person.

## COMP90054 Code of Honour

We expect every UoM student taking this course to adhere to it **Code of Honour** under which every learner-student should:

* Submit their own original work.
* Do not share answers with others.
* Report suspected violations.
* Engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve their results or dishonestly improve or damage the results of others.

Unethical behaviour is extremely serious and consequences are painful for everyone. We expect enrolled students/learners to take full **ownership** of your work and **respect** the work of teachers and other students.


**I hope you enjoy the project and learn from it**, and if you still **have doubts about the project and/or this specification** do not hesitate asking in the [Piazza Course Discussion Forum](https://piazza.com/unimelb.edu.au/fall2020/comp90054/home) and we will try to address it as quickly as we can!

**GOOD LUCK!**
